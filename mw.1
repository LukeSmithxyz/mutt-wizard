.SH NAME
mw \- mutt-wizard \- autoconfigure email accounts for neomutt and isync
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mw
<command>
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B mw
takes a user email account and sets up a terminal-based email interface with it for
.B neomutt.
This can include offline email with
.B isync/mbsync
and configs for
.B msmtp
for sending mail, and passwords automatically encrypted and stored with
.B pass.
.SH COMMANDS
.TP
.B add
configure an email account
.TP
.B ls
list all email accounts configured by mutt-wizard
.TP
.B delete
delete the configuration files for an already configured email account
.TP
.B purge
totally purge all local mutt-wizard/mbync/msmtp settings
.TP
.B cron
toggle a cronjob that will automatically sync mail with
.B mailsync
as often as you wish
.SH DETAILS
.TP
.B Mail location
If the user chooses to keep offline email with
.B isync,
it will be kept in
.I $MAILDIR
which defaults to
.I $XDG_DATA_HOME/share/mail/
which defaults to
.I ~/.local/share/mail/.
.B notmuch
can be used to index and search this mail by giving this directory when first running
.B notmuch setup.
If you have not set up notmuch before, mutt-wizard will automatically set it up in the background the first time you add an account.
.TP
.B muttrc files
mutt-wizard will create a muttrc file for each created account holding account-specific details. These will appear in
.I $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mutt/accounts/.
$XGD_CONFIG_HOME default to ~/.config.
Note that mutt-wizard will also source these files and create the bindings to switch between them, and these will appear in your default
.I $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mutt/muttrc
file.
.TP
.B Mail deletion
Neither
.B delete
or
.B purge
will delete downloaded mail for for safety (and time)'s sake. If you want to delete downloaded mail, do so manually by removing it from the directory above.
.TP
.B Default settings
mutt-wizard has many default settings that focus on making it aesthetically pleasing and supplying more vim-like bindings. These can be found in
.I /usr/share/mutt-wizard/mutt-wizard.muttrc
and the default mailcap file can be found in
.I
/usr/share/mutt-wizard/mailcap.
Any of these settings can be overwritten in
.I $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mutt/muttrc,
but be mindful that your overriding binds should appear after the
.I
mutt-wizard.muttrc
file is sourced.
.TP
.B Detecting server settings
mutt-wizard has a repository of email services and their server information kept in
.I /usr/share/mutt-wizard/domains.csv
which is used to automatically configure email settings.
If your email provider is not found there, it will prompt you to input your email service's IMAP and SMTP server information which can usually be found by searching online.

If you would like to help develop mutt-wizard for others, you are invited to add this service information to
.I domains.csv
on mutt-wizard's Github <https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/mutt-wizard> or Gitlab <https://gitlab.com/lukesmithxyz/mutt-wizard> pages.
.TP
.B Gmail accounts
Google will require you to allow "less-secure" (third party) applications or use two-factor authentication in order to access their IMAP servers to download your mail.
If you use Gmail, be sure to handle this before running mutt-wizard <https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255>.
.B Protonmail accounts
Protonmail users must use the Protonmail Bridge <https://protonmail.com/bridge/> to access their IMAP and SMTP servers.
This too should be configured before running mutt-wizard.
.B Enterprise and university accounts
Many universities and businesses might host their domain's email via Google or another service.
This often requires a special IMAP/SMTP-specific password that you must generate and use.
Again, mutt-wizard can handle these systems, but only once they've been set up.
.TP
.B Password decryption
mutt-wizard uses
.I pass
and therefore
.I gpg
to decrypt your passwords.
Provided your GPG key has a password, this might mean that you will be prompted for your GPG password the first time you sync or send mail in a session.
Once your password is cached, it might also expire later as well.

Because of this I strongly recommend the program
.I pam-gnupg
<https://github.com/cruegge/pam-gnupg> which automatically unlocks your GPG password on login and keeps it active.
This gives you secure access to all your email accounts on your system without ever having to input a password.

If you don't want to use this program, you can also increase the cache time of an inputted GPG password with the
.I default-cache-ttl
and
.I max-cache-ttl
variables in your
.I
gpg-agent.conf.
.SH MUTT-WIZARD'S NEOMUTT CONFIGURATION
Here is a list of not only mutt-wizard's particular defaults, but what you need, to get the most out of email accounts configured with mutt-wizard.
.TP
.B Color
mutt-wizard's default settings add color to messages in the index and color mail details to make them easier to see.
New mail, in addition to being marked by the typical N, will also be bold.
.TP
.B Movement with h/j/k/l
Use vim keys to move down
.I j
or up
.I k
in mail, while
.I l
opens mail, then the attachment view, then an attachment, while
.I h
is the reverse.
While mail is open, go to next or previous mail with
.I J
and
.I K.
In the mail index,
.I d
and
.I u
go down and up by a half page and
.I gg
and
.I G
go to the very top and very bottom.
.TP
.B Search mail
If you have
.B notmuch
configured with your proper mail directory (see above), you may run
.I ctrl-f
to search for mail containing any given sequence.
Even without notmuch,
.I L
limits mail, showing only those with the given sequence in the subject while
.I A
shows all mail (same as limiting to "all").
.TP
.B Deleting mail
.I D
deletes mail, while
.I U
undeletes it (type in mail number to get to deleted mail). Note that
.I S
saves your mailbox, finalizing deletion. If you have a
.I Trash
box, deleted mail is moved there. If you want it to skip that and simply be deleted, comment out or remove the
.I set trash
line in that account's muttrc.
.TP
.B Send mail
.I m
creates a new mail message;
.I r
replies to the selected message;
.I R
replies all to the selected message and
.I f
fowards the selected message.
.TP
.B Compose mail screen
Once you write mail and save the buffer you will be brought to the compose screen. Press
.I a
to add attachments, use
.I s/t/c/b/d
to change the subject/to/CC/BCC/description. Press
.I S
to change the signature/encryption. Press
.I y
to send the mail.
.TP
.B Saving and autocompleting email addresses with abook
Install the optional dependency abook and you will be able to save the sender's email address with
.I a.
Once this is done, when you are typing in any email/contact prompt, you may press
.I Tab
to find contacts matching your input. Although abook is often used with mutt, it is also a useful program in its own right.
.TP
.B Switching and moving mail between mailboxes
The
.I g
key can be paired with several other keys to automatically move to another mailbox: gi: Inbox; gs: Sent; gd: Drafts; ga: Archive; gS: Spam; gj: Junk; gt: Trash. These bindings will only be present for accounts that have the boxes in question. Instead of
.I g,
you can also press
.I C
to copy mail or
.I M
to move mail to the same boxes.
.TP
.B Switching between accounts
mutt-wizard can configure as many as nine accounts each numbered by the lowest available number when configured. Press
.I i
followed by an account's number to change to that account: i2, i5, etc.
.I ctrl-b
to open a menu to select a url you want to open in you browser.
.TP
.B Sidebar
mutt-wizard enables the sidebar by default which displays your account's boxes with mail tallies.
.I B
will toggle the sidebar. Move up and down in it with
.I ctrl-k/j.
Open a box with
.I ctrl-o.
.TP
.B More information
Remember that you can press
.I ?
at any time in neomutt to get a list of all key-bindings and functions. This list can also vary for different context menus.
