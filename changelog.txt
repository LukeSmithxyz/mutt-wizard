Generate man page from readme, to avoid duplicate descriptions.
Readme in rst instead of md.
Separate changelog.txt.

Add tests and made bug fixes

*urlscan* instead of *urlview*

*wm* generates *mutt* config on every full sync,
-  to reflect changes in mailboxes in the shortcuts
-  to reflect changes in *mbsync/getmail* config in *mutt* config

*wm* integrates *mailsync*,
not to overload the system namespace and because of code reuse

*remove|rm* instead of *delete*, *list|ls* instead of only *ls*

Make channel name equal to email address
to avoid choosing a new name for the same thing.

Other more vim-like shortcut changes

*gm/gM* to sync mail inside *mutt*, as *o/O* has a *mutt* assignment already.

Honor *$MAILDIR*, *$XDG_CONFIG_HOME*, *$XDG_CACHE_HOME*, if defined.

`isync`/`mbsync` has replaced `offlineimap` as the backend.
Offlineimap was error-prone, bloated, used obsolete Python 2 modules and required separate steps to install the system.

`mw` is now an installed program instead of just a script needed to be kept in your mutt folder.

`dialog` is no longer used (less bloat) and the interface is simply text commands.

More autogenerated shortcuts that allow quickly moving and copying mail between boxes.

More elegant attachment handling.

Image/video/pdf attachments without relying on the neomutt instance.

abook integration by default.

The messy template files and other directories have been moved or removed, leaving a clean config folder.

msmtp configs moved to `~/.config/` and mail default location moved to `~/Mail`, reducing mess in `~`.

`pass` is used as a password manager instead of separately saving passwords.

Script is POSIX sh compliant.

Addition of a manual `man mw`.
