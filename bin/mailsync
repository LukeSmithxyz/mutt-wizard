# - Syncs mail for all accounts, or a single account given as an argument.
# - Displays a notification showing the number of new mails.
# - Displays a notification for each new mail with its subject displayed.
# - Runs notmuch to index new mail.
# - This script can be set up as a cron job for automated mail syncing.

# There are many arbitrary and ugly features in this script because it is
# inherently difficult to pass environmental variables to cronjobs and other
# issues. It also should at least be compatible with Linux (and maybe BSD) with
# Xorg and MacOS as well.

# Run only if not already running in other instance
pgrep mbsync >/dev/null && { echo "mbsync is already running."; exit ;}

# First, we have to get the right variables for the mbsync file, the pass
# archive, notmuch and the GPG home.  This is done by searching common profile
# files for variable assignments. This is ugly, but there are few options that
# will work on the maximum number of machines.
